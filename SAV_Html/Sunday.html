            <h2 class="header">What to Expect</h2>
            <p class="details">We gather at 9am and 11am on Sunday mornings. We know that going to a church for the first time can be an intimidating experience with many questions.
                 To help ease your visit, here are a few things that will be helpful to know.</p>
            <h2 class="header">Before the Service</h2>
            <p class="details">There is no need to dress up. Please feel comfortable in your normal weekend clothes. When you arrive at Vine Church, there will be a parking attendant there to guide you. After parking, enter through our main entrance doors. You will see a greeter there to welcome you. When you walk in, feel free to grab a cup of coffee and find a seat in our auditorium, 
                the service will begin shortly.</p>
            
            <h2 class="header">Kids & Youth</h2>
            <p class="details">We have an excellent Kids Program with trusted and trained workers. Your children will learn about Jesus in an age-appropriate, fun, engaging way, while in a safe environment. 
                Check-in for the Kids Program opens 15 minutes before the service starts.</p>
                <p class="details">Middle school students meet in the North Building during the services. No check-in is necessary. High school students are welcome to join us in the service. Additionally they will have their own service on Sunday afternoons. Also, on Wednesday nights, middle school students meet in the North building for youth group. 
                    For more details and meeting times, check out our youth page.</p>
            <h2 class="header">During the Service</h2>
            
            <h3 class="sub-header">Worship</h3>
            <p class="details">To begin our service, our worship team will make their way up to the stage and lead us in 3-4 songs of worship to God. The worship music is current, ranging from modern hymns to contemporary worship songs. 
                At Vine Church, this means a biblical and heartfelt response to the Living God. </p>
            <h3 class="sub-header">Bible Teaching</h3>
            <p class="details">After worship, one of our staff will welcome the church and give any announcements. Then one of our pastors will come up and teach clearly from the Bible (we use the English Standard Version).  We believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God; therefore, we teach it as it is, rather than teaching our own opinion. We aim to teach the Bible in a way that is clear and understandable to all, regardless of church experience.
                 We hope that you leave challenged and inspired to apply the Bible to your life.</p>
            <h2 class="header">After the Service</h2>
            <p class="details">The service lasts about an hour and a half. Once it ends, feel free to hang around and meet people afterward if you would like. 
                For parents, please pick up your kids within 15 minutes of the service ending.</p>
